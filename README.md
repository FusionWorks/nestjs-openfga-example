## Introduction

In modern web applications, managing user authentication and authorization is crucial for ensuring security and providing appropriate access to resources. This demo project illustrates how to seamlessly integrate **Auth0** for handling user authentication and **OpenFGA** for managing fine-grained permissions within a **NestJS** framework.

**Note:** This project serves as supplementary material for the [FusionWorks article](https://fusion.works/fine-grained-authorization-for-apis-with-nestjs-and-openfga/), providing practical examples and source code to enhance your understanding of fine-grained authorization in NestJS applications.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using Auth0.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define and manage user roles and permissions with OpenFGA.
- **API Documentation**: Interactive API documentation using Swagger, secured with Auth0 authentication.
- **Projects Management**: Create and manage projects with roles such as Owner, Admin, and Member.
- **Secure Endpoints**: Protect API endpoints with JWT authentication and permission guards.

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **Auth0**: A flexible authentication and authorization platform.
- **OpenFGA**: An open-source fine-grained authorization system.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing project data.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation and testing.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (local or hosted instance)
- **Auth0 Account**: [Sign up here](https://auth0.com/)
- **Okta FGA Account**: [Sign up here](https://fga.dev/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FusionWorks/nestjs-openfga-example.git
   cd nestjs-openfga-example
   ```
nstall Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configuration
1. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and populate it with the following variables:

env
Copy code
# Auth0 Configuration
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-auth0-audience
AUTH0_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-oauth-client-id

# OpenFGA Configuration
FGA_API_URL=your-openfga-api-url
FGA_STORE_ID=your-openfga-store-id
FGA_CLIENT_ID=your-openfga-client-id
FGA_CLIENT_SECRET=your-openfga-client-secret
FGA_API_TOKEN_ISSUER=your-openfga-token-issuer
FGA_API_AUDIENCE=your-openfga-audience

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri

# Application Port
PORT=3000
Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details:

Auth0: Obtain these from your Auth0 dashboard under your application's settings.
OpenFGA: Sign up at fga.dev and create an authorization model to get the necessary credentials.
MongoDB: Provide your MongoDB connection string.
2. Define the Authorization Model
Using fga.dev, design and host your authorization model. For this demo, the model is defined as:

plaintext
Copy code
model
  schema 1.1

  type user

  type project
    relations
      define admin: [user] or owner
      define member: [user] or admin or owner
      define owner: [user]
This model sets up the following relationships:

Owner: A user with full permissions on the project.
Admin: A user who can manage other members or be an owner.
Member: A user with standard access, who can be promoted to admin or owner.
Ensure your OpenFGA store is configured with this model.

Running the Application
1. Build the Project
bash
Copy code
npm run build
2. Start the Application
Development Mode (with hot-reloading):

bash
Copy code
npm run start:dev
Production Mode:

bash
Copy code
npm run start:prod
The application will start on the port specified in your .env file (default is 3000).

API Documentation
Interactive API documentation is available via Swagger. To access it:

Ensure the application is running.
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/api in your browser.
Authenticate using Auth0 to access and test the API endpoints.
Testing
Running Tests
The project includes end-to-end (e2e) tests using Jest and Supertest.

bash
Copy code
npm run test:e2e
Linting
Ensure code quality and consistency by running ESLint:

bash
Copy code
npm run lint
Formatting
Automatically format your code with Prettier:

bash
Copy code
npm run format
Project Structure

Authorization Model
The authorization model defines the types of users and their relationships with projects. Here's a brief overview:

Types:

user: Represents the users in the system.
project: Represents the projects managed within the application.
Relations for project:

admin: A user who can manage other users or be an owner.
member: A user with standard access, who can be promoted to admin or owner.
owner: A user with full permissions on the project.
This model ensures a clear hierarchy and permission flow, allowing for scalable and maintainable authorization logic.
